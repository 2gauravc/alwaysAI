In this repo we will be using alwaysAI for human pose estimation.

## Set-Up 

We will be using the alwaysAI CLI interface. 

1. Go to the alwaysAI (dashboard)[https://alwaysai.co/dashboard] and create a "New Project". 

2. Choose "Human Pose Estimation" template. Give the project a name and create it 

3. Follow the instructions under "Run your App". This includes: 

- Download the CLI  package 
- Install it 

On the Command Line (i.e. Terminal on Mac), do the following: 

- Login (aai app user login)
- Configure install and start the app 

## The App

When the app runs, it starts a service on port 5000. Go to port 5000 on your browser. 

With your webcam input, you will see the body keypoints identified and joined by blue lines.
